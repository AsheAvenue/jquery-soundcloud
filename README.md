#jQuery Soundcloud
Modernized version of the Soundcloud Stratus player which supports jQuery 1.9+ and PJAX

##About
This jQuery extension is based on the Soundcloud Stratus player from http://stratus.sc and is meant to update some dependencies.  The current Stratus 2 player depends on jQuery version < 1.9, and does not support PJAX.  This fork adds support for jQuery 1.9+ and PJAX.

##Usage
View http://stratus.sc/ for documentation on usage and customization.
